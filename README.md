## Dataset
A collection of public transport network data sets for 25 cities

## Research questions

**Possible research questions:**
- Which city is more vulnerable to disruptions?
- General: what makes a city more vulnerable 
- How can we make a network more robust?t
- What is ‘optimal’?

## Possible experiments
- Do random percolation
- Metric: average traffic time
- Make a function to calculate travel time
- If the metro line is disconnected, replace the disconnected edge with bus duration. 
- Visualize graphs with the correct position of nodes
- Analyze the robustness of networks
